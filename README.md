# Updates
V1.2 - 24/07/2020
Now compatible with the latest snapshot!
- pack updated to 20w30a
- some internal clean-up. Should be unnoticable.

V1.1 - 19/07/2020
Weekend update!
- added the swamplands biome
- altered biome colours to better match beta 1.7.3
- added biome dependent sky colours
- altered seasonal and rainforest tree spawning to more accurately mimic beta (seasonal forests now only spawn oak and big oak, rainforests have a better chance of spawning big oak trees)
